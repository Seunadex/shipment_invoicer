## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions & Assumptions

- **Legacy Schema Adaptation:** The system adapts a legacy French-named MySQL schema into idiomatic Rails models. Fields like `numero_bl` were renamed to `number`, `id_client` to `customer_id`, and relationships were inferred and enforced via associations and foreign keys.

- **Invoice Generation Logic:** A service object (`Demurrage::InvoiceGenerator`) checks for BLs that became overdue today and generates invoices at a flat rate of $80 per container per overdue day. Container count is computed as the sum of all six legacy `quantity_*` fields on the Bill of Lading.

- **Skip Logic for Open Invoices:** BLs are skipped if they already have any unpaid (status: `"init"`) invoices. This ensures that only one open invoice exists per overdue BL at a time.

- **Refund Guard Logic:** BLs that are flagged as `blocked_for_refund`, `exempt` or have associated refund requests (`remboursements`) with active statuses are excluded from invoicing. Only fully cancelled or absent refunds qualify.

- **Factory & Test Constraints:** FactoryBot and Faker are used in specs with character limits enforced to avoid validation errors (e.g. trimming names to â‰¤ 20 characters).
