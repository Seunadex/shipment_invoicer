## ðŸ§¾ Sample cURL Requests

### Generate invoices for overdue BLs:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoices/generate_overdue
```

### Sample Response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 12,
    "reference": "INV20240716-001",
    "number": "BL20240716X",
    "client_code": "CUST001",
    "client_name": "ABC Logistics",
    "amount": 240,
    "status": "init",
    "invoice_date": "2025-07-17T00:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

### View overdue invoices in browser (JSON):

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions & Assumptions

- **Legacy Schema Adaptation:** The system adapts a legacy French-named MySQL schema into idiomatic Rails models. Fields like `numero_bl` were renamed to `number`, `id_client` to `customer_id` and relationships were inferred using best practices.

- **Invoice Generation Logic:** A service object (`Demurrage::InvoiceGenerator`) checks for BLs that became overdue today and generates invoices at a flat rate of $80 per container per day. Container count is calculated as the sum of all `quantity_*` columns on the bill_of_ladding.

- **Skip Logic:** BLs with any unpaid (status: `"init"`) invoices are skipped to prevent duplicates. Paid invoices are ignored.

- **API & View Separation:** Invoice generation is triggered via a JSON-only API endpoint, while overdue invoices can be viewed either as JSON. The API is namespaced under `/api/invoices`.
